We are responsible for triaging the [infra](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/labels/infra) label.

For issues without a priority label:
 * Try to diagnose the issue, but if necessary, cc others to ask for help and leave untriaged.
 * Set a priority. The three priority labels are:
  * `priority:urgent` - The infrastructure is broken and tests are failing due to the breakage.
  * `priority:roadmap` - This is an important+tractable issue that we should resolve within 3 months, and may be be part of OKR planning.
  * `priority:backlog` - This is out of scope for the time-being. (Driving down the number of such issues may become part of P3 OKRs.)
 * For urgent issues, assign an owner or ping someone. Assign a specific person as owner if you know who should be working on it. Otherwise ping @foolip and/or @jgraham in the comments to take a look.
