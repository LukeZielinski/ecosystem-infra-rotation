Runs for stable Chrome, Firefox and Safari should happen at least daily.

If this check fails, file an issue on [wpt.fyi](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt.fyi) if all runs are affected, and otherwise on the repo that's responsible for the product that has stopped running, likely [results-collection](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/results-collection).
