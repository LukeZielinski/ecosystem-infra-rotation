We are responsible for triaging the [Blink>Infra](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=component%3ABlink%3EInfra&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids) component.

For unconfirmed/untriaged issues:
 * Try to diagnose the issue, but if necessary cc others to ask for help and leave untriaged.
 * Set a priority. The "target milestone" for P1 (need) and P2 (want) is taken to mean target dates set in OKRs, with the end of quarter being the default.
 * For P0-2, assign an owner:
  * WPT import/export: robertma@chromium.org
  * WebDriver or testdriver.js: kereliuk@chromium.org
  * Fallback: foolip@chromium.org
 * For P3, assign an owner if useful, otherwise set to available.
